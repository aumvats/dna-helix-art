# DNA Double Helix

A DNA double helix painted onto my GitHub contribution graph for **2022**.

Two sine waves intertwine across 52 weeks — crossing over every 8 columns with horizontal base-pair rungs connecting them — forming ~3.25 full rotations of the classic double helix. 680 carefully placed commits, zero actual biology involved.
